Working title for open source video editor.

Currently, there are no useful, cross-platform open source video editors.

My fiancee is currently using Movavi, which is proprietary and full of bugs.

This might well be slow in development, for several reasons:
- I have never written a win32 GUI app (windows will have to come first for pragmatic reasons)
- Video encoding/decoding is not my area of expertise.
- Cross platform will have to wait until I get something working in Windows first...
- I want to write it in C++, rather than C# (since it should eventually be cross-platform)
- A million other small things ...

We'll see how far this goes...
